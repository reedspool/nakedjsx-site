# Project: Concatenative JavaScript

After I explored Forth, I wondered if I could apply some of what I learned to my comfort zone of JavaScript in a browser environment. 

The TypeScript source code for the language [lives here](https://github.com/reedspool/reeds-website/blob/main/src/project-concatenative-javascript.tsx).

## Tests

If you see ❌ or 🚧, then that test has failed.

<div>First test: <span c="' Success' me >text">🚧</span></div>

<div>Leading and extra whitespace don't change anything: <span c="    ' Success'    me    >text   ">🚧</span></div>

<div>Emojis work: <span c="' ✅' me >text">🚧</span></div>

<div>`swap`: <span c="' ✅' ' ❌' swap me >text">🚧</span></div>

<div>`dup`: <span c="' ✅' dup me >text me >text">🚧</span></div>

<div>`drop`: <span c="' ✅' ' ❌' drop me >text">🚧</span></div>

<div>`over`: <span c="' ✅' ' ❌' over me >text">🚧</span></div>

<div>`rot`: <span c="' ✅' ' ❌' ' ❌' rot me >text">🚧</span></div>

<div>`&&`: <span c="true ' ✅' && me >text">🚧</span></div>

<div>`:` and `;`: <span c=": test ' ✅' ; test me >text">🚧</span></div>

<div>Click event: <span c="[ ' ✅' event target> >text ] ' click' me .addEventListener">🚧</span></div>

I reflected on [Hyperscript](https://hyperscript.org) and how it added a convenient layer on top of JavaScript. In my experience with Hyperscript, I was frustrated with extending the language. And that was one of the main strengths of what I'd learned of Forth. So I started this experiment as a way to explore some universe where a library as convenient as Hyperscript was as extensible as Forth.

I started with a script on this page.

I continued making progress in the time normally allotted for creative coding. Today's creative coding prompt was "some of my favorite things." JavaScript, exploring programming languages, and putting energy towards creative interfaces felt aligned with the prompt.

I succeeded in getting some small code on an HTML attribute to work how I expected! It was so fun to use JS's step debugger to walk through my code and see it work. I continued to make some more basic words, like `dup`, `swap`, and `drop`.
