# Project: Concatenative JavaScript

After I explored Forth, I wondered if I could apply some of what I learned to my comfort zone of JavaScript in a browser environment. 

The TypeScript source code for the language [lives here](https://github.com/reedspool/reeds-website/blob/main/src/project-concatenative-javascript.tsx).

## Tests

If you see ❌ or 🚧, then that test has failed.

<div>First test: <span c="' Success' me >text">🚧</span></div>

<div>Leading and extra whitespace don't change anything: <span c="    ' Success'    me    >text   ">🚧</span></div>

<div>Look in the console to see if this logs a checkmark: <span c="' Log test: ✅' log">🚧</span></div>

## Logbook

I reflected on [Hyperscript](https://hyperscript.org) and how it added a convenient layer on top of JavaScript. In my experience with Hyperscript, I was frustrated with extending the language. And that was one of the main strengths of what I'd learned of Forth. So I started this experiment as a way to explore some universe where a library as convenient as Hyperscript was as extensible as Forth.

I started with a script on this page.

I continued making progress in the time normally allotted for creative coding. Today's creative coding prompt was "some of my favorite things." JavaScript, exploring programming languages, and putting energy towards creative interfaces felt aligned with the prompt.

I succeeded in getting some small code on an HTML attribute to work how I expected! It was so fun to use JS's step debugger to walk through my code and see it work. I continued to make some more basic words, like `dup`, `swap`, and `drop`.

### Thu Feb 22 08:49:18 AM PST 2024

There were two different things I wanted to implement in my language. Well, re-implement. I'd struggled thinking of things I'd like to use my language for as I was writing it, because I invested most of my interest and drive in that moment into the language itself.

<Future>I wanted to reimplement both some hyperscript I'd written recently in <Link slug="project-typing-game-with-feedback-loops">my typing game</Link>. The hyperscript was relatively simple, but there was a lot that this language was missing to get there.</Future>

<Future>I wanted to reimplement <Link slug="project-explore-forth" hash="five-minute-timer-in-forth">a 5 minute timer I'd written in Forth</Link>.</Future>

Both of these ideas were pressing today since I wanted to give a presentation on this concept. I signed up to give the presentation to give me an accountability target for the day, and I had to admit that was motivating me!

I started taking incremental steps towards those things, to see how far I could get before the presentation. Since my hyperscript example relied heavily on variables, and I wasn't immediately sure how I'd implement the same thing in my language, I started with the forth example. I implemented `now` to get the current milliseconds and `typeof` to quickly test if the result was a number. Then, of course, I noticed that my Forth code also uses variables. But these are Forth-type variables, which are much more straightforward (now that I've read Starting Forth) than Hyperscript variables. So I pushed forward.

I got an implementation of variables that matched the most basic semantics from Forth. That is, my new words `@` and `!` could act successfully on the result of a variable. But pointer arithmetic would not work, since there was no linear memory behind it. In short, I faked it.

The next thing I had to tackle was waiting. Dot dot dot. Silence. Do nothing. Up to this point, my interpreter would execute every single bit of code as quickly as it could without pause or interruption. To do so, I'd have to hook my language in to JavaScript's event loop somehow. I wasn't sure how, but I created a dictionary word `sleep` to stare at where the implementation should go.

I got my basic test passing, and in the process I found a lot of inadequacies in my interpreter implementation. I had made many assumptions in order to move quickly towards the next incremental step. I felt good about the decisions I made up to this point, but also daunted by the challenges. And there was still yet more features to add! I still had my failing click event test, which now wasn't being executed at all.

Up to this point, I used the same interpreter for every distinct piece of code on the page. This worked until I introduced asynchronicity. The problem was that the interpreter was stateful, and each piece of code on the page (i.e. each `c=` HTML attribute) needed to set a different state. Previously this worked smoothly because each script would block until completion, and the next one could set the internal variables for itself without any conflict.

The solution I had in mind was to use a separate instance of each interpreter for each distinct script. And a pattern I'd already been using without understanding why became clear - I'd been passing around a "context object", `ctx`, where I was storing all the state. Well, not every piece of state, I hadn't been perfectly consistent. But if I refactored to make my use of the context object consistently, and make every other function entirely pure, then I could simply switch to a separate `ctx` for each script, and isolate all state therein. That worked! 

I was missing a lot of the functionality still to replicate my timer in Forth, but I realized I could do a different version of the same thing with separate scripts in separate HTML elements.

I made a rough-and-tumble, ad-hoc area to present this at RC:

<button class="cpnt-button mb-4" _="on click put the next <blockquote /> into document.body then remove me">Kinda fullscreenify</button>

<blockquote>
  <h1>`4 1 + . ." languages"`</h1>
    <div c="240000 sleep ' Time is up!' me >text">
        <div c=" ' Breathe out'  me >text 2500 sleep ' Breathe in' me >text 2500 sleep ' ' me >text"></div>

        <div c=" 60000 sleep ' 1 minute'  me >text"></div>
        <div c="120000 sleep ' 2 minutes' me >text"></div>
        <div c="180000 sleep ' 3 minutes' me >text"></div>
    </div>
</blockquote>

In my rush to prepare the above presentation, I accidentally made the timers all 10 times the duration, so one minute actually took 10 minutes to trigger. Whoops! Anyway, the presentation went very well.
