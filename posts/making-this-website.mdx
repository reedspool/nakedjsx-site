# Making This Website

My life is full of web pages. Sometimes I want to make web pages for myself.
This site is where I keep them.

My last website used React. I fell in love with JSX and MDX. I wanted to try a
website with JSX and MDX without React. And the `vanillajsx` project seemed to
fit my needs perfectly. 

I spoke to the developer of `vanillajsx` on Discord and he walked me through how
to make a website that fit some requirements I had:

1. JSX to compile static HTML pages.
1. MDX to write posts in plain text with custom components peppered throughout.
1. A post need only be in the right directory to get compiled without external
   configuration.

I achieved those goals with the help of the developer. He helped me with
explanations of how the software already worked as well as some enhancements. I
was grateful for the personal attention. He said he was grateful for the
challenges I presented, but I believe I got the better end of the deal.

It was pretty fast too. I made 1000 copies of a 2.5kb post file and it took 18.5
seconds to run the compilation command.

These were just the baseline requirements. I also wanted a few more things.

1. To use TailwindCSS
1. To use a development server

## TailwindCSS

I was not a fan of CSS-in-JS when I used it, but I was a fan of Tailwind. To
implement it, I knew I 'd need these steps:

1. Copy my existing Tailwind configuration and the basic CSS from my old website
   1. Now would be a good opportunity to pare down or my existing CSS
1. Test Tailwind to ensure it generated the CSS correctly
1. Link to the generated CSS file in the template shared by all posts
1. Hook up NakedJSX's build system to Tailwind's, so that they always build at
   the same time
1. Ideally hook up NakedJSX's development server so that when CSS changes, the
   page refreshes after building.
   
## Development Server
   
NakedJSX shipped with a dev server when I began to use it. But it did not work
perfectly. The issues were that:

1. It regenerated all posts when a post changed.
1. It did not refresh the page when a post changed.

Every time I edited a post, all of the posts were subsequently recompiled.
Ideally, only the post I had edited and saved would be recompiled.

When I edited a file outside my posts directory, the development server would
regenerate only that file which was took less than half a second. 

The documentation also promised that the page would refresh which I didn't
experience on either posts or other JSX files.

So far I hadn't had to dig in and understand the source code of NakedJSX to
solve any of my issues because the developer was so generous with his time. I
decided to push all my current work to GitHub and point him to it to ask for his help.
