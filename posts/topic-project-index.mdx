# All Projects

I like to make small experiments and track larger efforts. I try to link to all of them here which is <Link slug="projects-on-this-site">a project in itself</Link>.

One of my ongoing projects is to <Link slug="project-improve-this-website">improve this website</Link>.

It took some effort to work out <Link slug="project-write-script-and-style-tags">how to write ad-hoc `script` and `style` tags in JSX and MDX</Link> so I could do experiments with the comfort of markdown and components.

I <Link slug="project-add-popout">experimented with the idea of a pop-out</Link> to collect widgets from around a page to keep them visible.

I tried to make a <Link slug="project-precision-timer">precision timer in JavaScript</Link>.

I finally <Link slug="project-add-rss">added an RSS feed</Link> to this site.

I tried writing <Link slug="project-fizzbuzz-in-css">FizzBuzz in CSS</Link>.

I attempted a <Link slug="project-symbolic-differentiator">symbolic differentiator</Link>.

I tried to add <Link slug="project-supabase-authentication">Supabase authentication</Link> to my site.

I started playing <Link slug="project-dnd-game-2023">a DnD game</Link>.
