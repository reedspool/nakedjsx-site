# All Projects

I like to make small experiments and track larger efforts. I try to link to all of them here which is <Link slug="projects-on-this-site">a project in itself.</Link>.

One of my ongoing projects is to <Link slug="improve-this-website">improve this website</Link>.

I <Link slug="project-add-popout">experimented with the idea of a pop-out</Link> around a single visible line on a web page.
