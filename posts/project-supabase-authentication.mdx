# Project: Authenticate with Supabase

I wanted to experiment with [Supabase](https://supabase.com) authentication on this website.

I made a new project on Supabase and read some of their helpful Authentication documentation. I wanted to experiment with it hear so I installed their JavaScript library in my website via a CDN 

<script src="https://unpkg.com/@supabase/supabase-js@2"></script>

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@supabase/supabase-js@2"></script>
```

The text below will change to reflect whether the library is loaded right now.

<span>Checking if Supabase is loaded...</span>

{`
<script>
  let message = "Supabase is NOT loaded";
  if (supabase) message = "Supabase is loaded!"
  document.currentScript.previousElementSibling.innerText = message;
</script>
`}

I circled back to this finally after my site was on more stable footing with a custom JSX implementation. Many of my future plans relied on a private/controlled-access section of my site. I did not feel time or energy pressure on any of those future plans, so it felt like a good time to work on this, which would enable me to quickly move other things forward in the future.

Since my new JSX implementation handled `script` tags differently, I had to rework the above in a minor way.
