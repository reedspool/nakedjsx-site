# Project: Precision Timer in JavaScript

I wanted to make a countdown timer in JavaScript which was as precise to real-time as possible.

## Criteria

I'd call this a success if I could watch my timer count down from the set time to zero. I wanted to see the current time roll by in tenths or hundredths of seconds without sacrificing rendering performance even on a lower power device like my phone. I also wanted the ability to pause the timer and have it stop on a dime with no perceptible lag between my click and the timer stopping.

<Future>Once I felt my timer was strong, I started a new project to create a chess timer.</Future>

I started with the simplest idea I had which was to use `setTimeout`. I knew this wasn't a great solution, but I knew how to do it pretty quickly.

The code would look something like this:

```js
// 10 seconds in milliseconds
let timeLeft = 1000 * 10;

// Tenths of a second
let timeBetweenRenders = 1000 * 0.1;

// An element to render the current time into
const output = document.querySelector("output");

// Main recursive, asynchronous loop
const countDown = () => {
  output.innerHTML = timeLeft;
  if (timeLeft <= 0) return;
  timeLeft -= timeBetweenRenders;
  setTimeout(countDown, timeBetweenRenders);
};

// Begin
output.innerHTML = timeLeft;
countDown();
```

And here's how that looked with a button to start it:

<p class="flex flex-row w-full max-w-4xl justify-between gap-4 items-center">
  <output class="output-1">Hit Start to begin the countdown</output>
  <button class="cpnt-button" onclick="startCountdown1()">Start</button>
</p>

{`

<script>
  {
    let timeLeft; 
    let timeBetweenRenders = 1000 * 0.1 
    const output = document.querySelector("output.output-1")
    const countDown = () => {
      output.innerHTML = timeLeft;
      if (timeLeft <= 0) return;
      timeLeft -= timeBetweenRenders;
      setTimeout(countDown, timeBetweenRenders);
    }
    window.startCountdown1 = () => {
      timeLeft = 1000 * 10; 
      output.innerHTML = timeLeft;
      countDown();
    }
  }
</script>

`}

<Future>I noticed if I hit the `Start` button multiple times while the timer was running that unexpected things happened. I decided to wait to add control flow until later so that I could focus on the precision with respect to real-time first.</Future>

Humans don't think of time in milliseconds so I quickly wrote a function to format the milliseconds to seconds. I still wanted to see hundredths of seconds after a decimal point. Aside, why isn't "centiseconds" a word?:

```
const formatMillisToHundredths =
  (millis) => (millis / 1000).toFixed(2);
```

{`<script>
const formatMillisToHundredths = 
  (millis) => (millis / 1000).toFixed(2);
  </script>`}

My first example counted down in tenths of seconds. What if we tried hundredths of seconds with our formatter?

<p class="flex flex-row w-full max-w-4xl justify-between gap-4 items-center">
  <output class="output-2">Hit Start to begin</output>
  <button class="cpnt-button" onclick="startCountdown2()">Start</button>
</p>

{`

<script>
  {
    let timeLeft; 
    let timeBetweenRenders = 1000 * 0.01 
    const output = document.querySelector("output.output-2")
    const countDown = () => {
      output.innerHTML = formatMillisToHundredths(timeLeft);
      if (timeLeft <= 0) return;
      timeLeft -= timeBetweenRenders;
      setTimeout(countDown, timeBetweenRenders);
    }
    window.startCountdown2 = () => {
      timeLeft = 1000 * 10; 
      output.innerHTML = formatMillisToHundredths(timeLeft);
      countDown();
    }
  }
</script>

`}

That looked a lot better, and I noticed that it always ended at exactly zero. That made sense because I was subtracting the exact increments which I expected the `setTimeout` to take.

However it didn't feel so close to real seconds. My human perception of time is notably poor so I wanted to double check how close my timer was to real time.

I tried using `Date.now()` to take a timestamp at the beginning of my timer and the end, like:

```
const start = Date.now();
// Then, when my timer is over...
const end = Date.now();
const duration = end - start;
```

The `duration` would then be an approximation of how long my timer took. I knew [it wasn't precise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/now#reduced_time_precision) but it was an easy way to start.

The next timer runs for 3 seconds, ticking every hundredth of a second. Then it outputs its duration in seconds as calculated above.

<p class="flex flex-row w-full max-w-4xl justify-between gap-4 items-center">
  <output class="output-3 w-2xl">Hit Start</output>
  <output class="duration-output-3">Duration</output>
  <button class="cpnt-button" onclick="startCountdown3()">Start</button>
</p>

{`

<script>
  {
    let timeLeft; 
    let start;
    let timeBetweenRenders = 1000 * 0.01 
    const output = document.querySelector("output.output-3")
    const durationOutput = document.querySelector("output.duration-output-3")
    const originalContentDurationOutput = durationOutput.innerHTML;
    const countDown = () => {
      output.innerHTML = formatMillisToHundredths(timeLeft);
      if (timeLeft <= 0) {
        durationOutput.innerHTML = formatMillisToHundredths(Date.now() - start)
        return;
      }
      timeLeft -= timeBetweenRenders;
      setTimeout(countDown, timeBetweenRenders);
    }
    window.startCountdown3 = () => {
      timeLeft = 1000 * 3; 
      start = Date.now();
      durationOutput.innerHTML = originalContentDurationOutput;
      output.innerHTML = formatMillisToHundredths(timeLeft);
      countDown();
    }
  }
</script>

`}

If my timer code was very precise, the duration reported would always report `3.00`. But it _never_ did! The results I got on my computer ranged between `3.12` and `3.18`. I tried it on my phone and got between `3.44` and `3.48`, almost half a second longer than I wanted!

I knew this result was coming because `setTimeout` is notoriously imprecise. There are [many reasons](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/setTimeout#reasons_for_delays_longer_than_specified) why one of these timers can be a little late.

I had one idea for a strategy which was likely to be more precise. The basic premise was to use `setTimeout` without depending on the timing of when it called its callbacks. Instead, I would use a similar timing strategy to my measurement above, `elapsed = now - start`, to update my timer.

Here's the idea, with the same formatting and duration measurement strategy as above:

```js
// 5 seconds in milliseconds
let totalTime = 1000 * 5;

// Tenths of a second
let timeBetweenRenders = 1000 * 0.1;

// An element to render the current time into
const output = document.querySelector("output.timer");

// And another to render the duration
const duration = document.querySelector("output.duration");

// Main loop
const countDown = () => {
  const now = Date.now();
  const timeElapsed = now - start;
  output.innerHTML = format(totalTime - timeElapsed);
  if (timeElapsed >= totalTime) {
    duration.innerHTML = format(timeElapsed);
    return;
  }
  setTimeout(countDown, timeBetweenRenders);
};

// Begin
const start = Date.now();
output.innerHTML = format(totalTime);
countDown();
```

<p class="flex flex-row w-full max-w-4xl justify-between gap-4 items-center">
  <output class="output-4 w-2xl">Hit Start</output>
  <output class="duration-output-4">Duration</output>
  <button class="cpnt-button" onclick="startCountdown4()">Start</button>
</p>

{`

<script>
  {
    let totalTime; 
    let start;
    let timeBetweenRenders = 1000 * 0.01 
    const output = document.querySelector("output.output-4")
    const durationOutput = document.querySelector("output.duration-output-4")
    const originalContentDurationOutput = durationOutput.innerHTML;
    const countDown = () => {
      const now = Date.now();
      const timeElapsed = now - start;
      const timeLeft = totalTime - timeElapsed;
      output.innerHTML = formatMillisToHundredths(timeLeft);
      if (timeLeft <= 0) {
        durationOutput.innerHTML = formatMillisToHundredths(timeElapsed)
        return;
      }
      setTimeout(countDown, timeBetweenRenders);
    }
    window.startCountdown4 = () => {
      totalTime = 1000 * 5; 
      start = Date.now();
      durationOutput.innerHTML = originalContentDurationOutput;
      output.innerHTML = formatMillisToHundredths(totalTime);
      countDown();
    }
  }
</script>

`}

Some strange things occurred. First, the timer sometimes ended on `0.00` seconds, but not always! Often it ended with a negative sign in front of it, and even `-0.01`. The duration sometimes reported `5.00` as I'd hoped, but other times it reported `5.01`. Better than the previous result, but not perfect!

<Future>I mentioned above that my measurement was imprecise as well due to the limits of `Date.now()`. So while my main goal was to improve the timer itself, I also wanted a better measurement system to increase my confidence. So I tried using the ["Performance API"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance_API/High_precision_timing) to perform my measurements. Since I was using `Date.now()` for my timer as well, I decided to switch out both at once and see what happened.</Future>
