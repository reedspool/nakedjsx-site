# Project: What can Vanilla JS learn from Hyperscript?

I am fascinated by [Hyperscript](https://hyperscript.org). It's so fun to use. 

I've made some stuff in Hyperscript. I've written Snake in it. I wrote the Konami Code goof in it. I wrote a fun experiment to replicate the functionality of Scratch with Blockly and Hyperscript together. I wrote a diet app for myself.

<Future>I linked to the projects which I mentioned above.</Future>

I love to write in Hyperscript. The syntax reads like English and the semantics match how I think about the domain..

GitHub user `gnat` is always seen in the HTMX discord. His project [Surreal](https://github.com/gnat/surreal) achieves a lot fo what I'm describing here.

Some editing.

If an early-career developer asked me if Hyperscript were right for them, I would really want to say yes, but I would say no as of this writing.

<Future>
I made another post about the reasons I wouldn't recommend Hyperscript to keep this project focused on positive, constructive thoughts about what Hyperscript gets right and what JavaScript can learn from it.

I listed some reasons, just to get them off my mind in the moment:

* Relies on domain/cultural knowledge of DOM
* Doesn't solve enough issues consistently to alleviate any need of JavaScript
* Errors are sometimes undiagnosable without debugging JavaScript

I noticed a common theme to my thoughts: That you have to know JavaScript already. I think that's why my response would be different if an expert frontend developer asked me about Hyperscript. I'd trust an experienced JavaScript developer to speak the underlying language of Hyperscript, the subtext. But maybe I was just out of touch with the beginner web developer mindset and I should trust them more.

I knew as written these were crap and I needed to refine my thoughts and find examples or do some experiments to share it responsibly.

Programming in Hyperscript feels like a paradigm shift from JavaScript. There are a few aspects of that paradigm shift which I think could be applied as learnings to write JavaScript which feels better.

I tried to identify some of the concrete differences between vanilla JavaScript and Hyperscript whicih might contribute to them feeling so wildly different.

<Future>
 Hyperscript encourages Event-driven interface programming by encouraging message-passing between DOM elements-as-actors).
</Future>

<Future>
DSL for selection narrowing and searching relative to the DOM position of the current DOM element
</Future>

<Future>
Asynch transparency
</Future>

<Future>
Locality of Behavior
</Future>

<Future>
I broke down each of the above aspects with Hyperscript code and a JavaScript example.
