<Link slug="topic-recurse-center" hash="recurse-center-starting-uxn-and-playdate">Started during RC, soon after I got my Playdate in the mail</Link>.

I found the Playdate Uxn connection via ["awesome-uxn"](https://github.com/hundredrabbits/awesome-uxn?tab=readme-ov-file#applications). Following [these instructions](https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/uxn-playdate), I installed some dependencies:

```
sudo apt-get install gcc-arm-none-eabi clang # Debian
```

<Future>After I installed the PlaydateSDK, I circled back to these instructions at the Build section, and ran `export PLAYDATE_SDK_PATH=/home/neauoire/Documents/playdate/PlaydateSDK-1.13.1 make` as instructed</Future>

Started with https://play.date/dev/ and hit the button to download the Playdate SDK 2.1.1 for Linux.

Downloaded the [PlayDate Mirror](https://play.date/mirror/) to run Playdate stuff on my machine. THen I realized that Mirror was not actually what I wanted - I thought it was a VM, but it was more like a screen-viewer-over-USB for a live, running Playdate. 

<Future>I watched [this tutorial for Lua](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4o7n0LNQhA), the first part of a series on development for the Playdate</Future> 

I began reading [Inside Playdate](https://sdk.play.date/2.1.1/Inside%20Playdate.html), the Lua-based documentation.

<Future>I also checked out [Inside the Playdate with C](https://sdk.play.date/2.1.1/Inside%20Playdate%20with%20C.html), the parallel, more indepth version of its Lua counterpart.</Future>

Following some [Uxn](https://github.com/hundredrabbits/awesome-uxn) [links](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/left.html), got to [this instuctional video about LEAP technology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_TlE_U_X3c), which I'd never heard of, but I suppose was connected to the development of Vim's character search buttons which I use all the time. I didn't know which came first, though.
