# Project: Improve This Website

My life is full of web pages. Sometimes I want to make web pages for myself. I want to have a nice home for those pages. So I work to improve this website to make that home nicer over time.

## Criteria

I'll view this project as successful if my site continually improves over time. I don't have any final goal. I just want a personal website which feels nice to me.

## Project Log

My last website used React. I fell in love with JSX and MDX. I wanted to try a website with JSX and MDX without React. And the NakedJSX project seemed to fit my needs perfectly.

I spoke to the developer of NakedJSX on Discord and he walked me through how to make a website that fit some requirements I had:

1. JSX to compile static HTML pages.
1. MDX to write posts in plain text with custom components peppered throughout.
1. A post need only be in the right directory to get compiled without external configuration.

I achieved those goals with the help of the developer. He helped me with explanations of how the software already worked as well as some enhancements. I was grateful for the personal attention. He said he was grateful for the challenges I presented, but I believe I got the better end of the deal.

NakedJSX was pretty fast too. I made 1000 copies of a 2.5kb post file and it took 18.5 seconds to compile the entire site.

These were just the baseline requirements. I also wanted a few more things.

1. To use TailwindCSS
1. To use a development server

### TailwindCSS

I was a fan of Tailwind. To implement it, I thought I 'd need these steps:

1. Copy my existing Tailwind configuration and the basic CSS from my old website (removing any irrelevant styles)
1. Test Tailwind to ensure it generated the CSS correctly
1. Link to the generated CSS file in the HTML template shared by all posts
1. Hook up NakedJSX's build system to Tailwind's, so that they always build at the same time
1. Ideally hook up NakedJSX's development server so that when CSS changes, the page refreshes after building.

So I copied the config JS files and base CSS:

1. `postcss.config.js`
1. `tailwind.config.js`
1. `style.css`

I reviewed all these files and removed a lot of irrelevant or unused kruft.

Then I pulled up the official Tailwind installation instructions to review.

In my previous project, Vite automatically configured PostCSS. So I researched PostCSS to see how I might use it standalone. I wanted to avoid the complication of Vite in this project. I discovered PostCSS's CLI which excited me as I wouldn't have to use any other build tool.

I had to install the PostCSS, its CLI, and a few dependencies that I found useful in the old project:

```
npm install -D postcss postcss-cli postcss-import @tailwindcss/nesting postcss-nesting tailwindcss autoprefixer
```

I wrote a simple command for the PostCSS CLI in `package.json` in the `scripts` section. It just worked and which encouraged me.

```
"build:css": "postcss css/style.css --output build/build.css",
```

I thought I would have to time this with NakedJSX's build system. But it occurred to me once I got PostCSS working that there was no timing conflict. PostCSS could write the output `build.css` and NakedJSX could write the output HTML files. No sweat. I could run both dev servers simultaneously in different processes, and I could run both build commands in sequence or parallel.

Next I had to link the CSS output in the HTML output. This was as easy as adding a single line to my NakedJSX JS files.

```jsx
Page.AppendHead(<link rel="stylesheet" href="./build.css" />);
```

### Development Server

NakedJSX shipped with a dev server when I began to use it. But it did not work perfectly. The issues were that:

1. It regenerated all posts when a post changed.
1. It did not refresh the page when a post changed.

Every time I edited a post, all of the posts were subsequently recompiled. Ideally, only the post I had edited and saved would recompile.

When I edited a file outside my posts directory, the development server would regenerate only that file. That took less than half a second which was nice. But I wanted to focus on writing posts, and that would be slow.

The documentation also promised that the browser page would refresh when the file was recompiled. I didn't experience that on either posts or other JSX files.

The developer was so generous with his time so far. I decided to push all my current work to GitHub and point him to it to ask for his help.

He mentioned an idea: Because my NakedJSX script should always write the output after the input file was last saved, the output file should always be newer than the input. Therefore, I could check each input file against each output file, and only re-compile if the output was older than the input.

So I tried it. I used Node's `fs.access` and `fs.stat` to read the input and the output and determine which was newer. I found the same issue which the NakedJSX developer mentioned. Unfortunately, the development server wouldn't register any files which were not exported, so those files with no changes would never recompile again. To get around this, I wrote imports for each file but included a flag so signal if it should recompile or not.

This still did not solve the issue. When one of my post files changed, `all.mjs` was not re-executed. Was its output cached? I added `console.log` messages to `all.mjs`, but I never saw them again after the first build.

As an aside, the development server did not respond to Control-C. Instead, I had to hit "x" to exit the development server. I was so used to Control-C to exit out of other programs, and the lack of response confused me.

Another random issue I experienced was the output of the server sometimes overwrote my `console.log` messages. This limited my basic debugging strategy.

I tried to use a random attribute with underscores in my JSX and I got this error.

```
0.212: ERROR: Error: Invalid attribute name: my_random_attribute
    at requireValidAttributeName (file:///home/human/projects/nakedjsx-site/node_modules/nakedjsx/node_modules/@nakedjsx/core/runtime/page/document.mjs:313:15)
```

I learned that I couldn't have underscores `_` in my attribute names. In Vanilla HTML and JS, I wrote attributes with similar structures to BEM CSS which uses a lot of underscores. It was easy to replace underscores with dashes `-`. I found a [definitive resource](https://stackoverflow.com/a/926136) which explained that underscores are valid in HTML attribute names. StackOverflow isn't usually definitive, so I was grateful that answer refered to [the spec](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#attributes-2).

I understand that arbitrary attributes turn HTML invalid, but it's fun to add a random attribute to target with a CSS selector like `[my-random-attribute]`. I learned at some point that CSS attribute selectors are a performance trap, but optimization must balance against fun in personal projects.

I also tried out the NakedJSX config file with `npm run build -- --config-save`. This was nice! I'd love to add a switch to this.

<Future>I tried my hand at adding a configuration for turning off the arbitrary attribute validation. Maybe I could configure the allowable characters in an HTML attribute. Also it would be nice to turn the error into a warning because then I could review a report of many such issues instead of stopping processing with the first instance.</Future>

I wanted to add links between pages, but I found I was renaming pages frequently in this early stage of development. To lower the friction to name changes, I [made a component](https://github.com/reedspool/nakedjsx-site/blob/main/components/Link.jsx) which would throw an error if I used an incorrect name for another post.

<Future>I experimented with `ref` to collect all of the links in each post to create backlinks.</Future>

<Future>I experimented with post-processing the HTML output of NakedJSX with an HTML parser to collect all the links in each post to create back links.</Future>

### Sun Sep  3 10:27:34 PDT 2023

<Future>I investigated why my Link component seemed to be adding a space (with an underline) unnecessarily.</Future>

<Future>I wanted a way to collect all the content of all my Future components on the entire site into one place for a high level view of to-dos</Future>

<Future>I wanted a way to collect and view all of the content of my Future components on the page I was looking at at the click of a button</Future>

<Future>To get over the issues with how NakedJSX reported errors in MDX compilation, I made a script to compile all MDX, or a specific MDX page on my site to JSX, without using NakedJSX at all.</Future>
