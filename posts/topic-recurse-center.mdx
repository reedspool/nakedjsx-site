# Recurse Center

My friend Bryan Braun recommended I apply. I'd heard about RC before but didn't consider it for myself for whatever reason. I'm thankful to Bryan for the shift in my opinion.

### Thu Oct 5 22:32:05 PDT 2023

I accepted the offer to join the first Winter cohort of 2024 this week. I'd like to be on-site at the Brooklyn location for some part of it.

While I figure out how I'll get to and live in Brooklyn I also have to work out a project to focus on when I begin there. I have several ideas.

One idea is to enable myself to edit this very website from a browser. Currently I edit it in Emacs or Vi. But I like to look at it on the web, so I'd like to edit it there too. There are good code editor components for JavaScript already like CodeMirror. But there are many questions I don't have straightforward answers for. How would I edit the site given that it's written in MDX? It's not WYSIWYG. The source code of my site is not the same as the HTML and CSS and JS which is displayed on the browser. And then, once I've made some edit to that source, how would I persist it? Currently I store my site in git, on GitHub. Could I still do that? Or would I need another storage method like a document store?

First day. Went to talks. Met people in small breakouts. Played with Virtual RC, a shared, persistent virtual 2D space where I have my own desk (a certain colored square on the 2D grid with my initials on it). I'm not sure how I'll use that space, but I had fun on my first walk around.

Attended a Creative Coding meetup, brainstormed with Alex and Tristan, learned about the [CMU pronunciation dictionary](https://svn.code.sf.net/p/cmusphinx/code/trunk/cmudict/cmudict-0.7b).

Learned about [Mavo](https://mavo.io/), a tool for building editable HTML pages. I spent some time exploring and reading their documentation.

Generally overwhelmed with my own excitement and Zulip messages.

Learned more about Zulip, like their [time picker](https://zulip.com/help/global-times) to translate to local time zones. Installed Zulip on my e-ink phone so I can hopefully limit my screentime while staying in touch.

Spelunked in some [RC music archives](https://mcg.recurse.com/sessions/139) and found [gems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wPWFWUsPBw).

Looked at [Playdate dev stuff](https://play.date/dev/) for a while. I got a Playdate as a gift a few days ago. I love it and I might explore a project on it.

Pairing workshop. Worked with Kevin to get [some colored circles to cycle colors when clicked](https://replit.com/@galligankevinp/DisfiguredImpishLeads), on the way to a Mastermind game. 

After the workshop, I saw clearly why RC promotes the benefits of pairing so much. Such a variety of benefits from socialization to experimentation to inspiration. And the cost? Just put yourself out there and turn on your microphone.

Still overwhelmed by Zulip. E-ink view definitely helped me feel more comfortable, but it felt impossible to keep up with the deluge of daily check-in threads! At some point, I will have to prioritize instead of my vain attempts to keep up to date with everyone's, but until then, I have accepted the pain. I want to see what everyone's into, so I'll accept the pain!

I set up Cal.com to ease organization of quick connections. Though Erika mentioned [their concerns about security/privacy](https://recurse.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/26440-small-questions/topic/managing.20schedules.20and.20appointments/near/405010727). I heard about it from Faisal when he shared his script (https://recurse.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/18961-checkins/topic/Faisal.20Al.20Qasimi/near/409512208) for scheduling in Zulip's formatting.

Had a great chat with Vedashree and Raghav talking about web animation, GSAP, web development, micro interactions, [Josh W Comeau's site](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/) CSS, old-school web design, using real life prints in web design.

Coffee with P.B. To (she/they) (W2'24), talked about visualizers and the web audio and web GL, Playdate. We also talked about the history of React and how all the abstractions it provides. She told me about a coworker who couldn't achieve a Spotify audio player scrubber in React-land, flummoxed by refs. How React is a functional veneer (PB's word) over the web's landscape of imperative. We both got pumped for Bret Victor. Then we talked about <Link slug="project-new-static-site-generator">my implementation of framework-less JSX and MDX</Link> for my website.

I loved sitting in the voice chat cafe in RC Together

Had an idea for a Playdate game: Replicate the experience of the famous Japanese train engineer simulator, ["DENSHA de GO!"](https://youtu.be/ZqqgTyb7UJE?si=STjS0DrOv3bMtQfZ&t=280) using the [crank as a brake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuEeUlJe9JE).

[Asked a question and got an answer about calendar management and RC](https://recurse.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/26440-small-questions/topic/Want.20both.20the.20full.20RC.20calendar.20and.20only.20my.20events/near/411288756)

### Fri Jan  5 08:36:14 AM PST 2024

I had an idea to host an event at an event about hosting events. Here's my brain dump on the idea. If you could see yourself co-hosting something like this, let me know and we can collab. Otherwise I'll throw it on the calendar and just try it.

```spoiler An idea for an event
> What's That? Wednesday

Everyone is welcome without preparation.

Those who do want to prepare ("presenters"), here is your goal: 

> Bring something that will make others say "what's that?!"

Here's how it might go, in rough chronological order:

Presenters let the facilitators know that they have prepared something at the beginning (Maybe in the future this happens before, to maximize time for presentations).

Facilitators share the order of presenters to reduce surprise.

I'd love to copy this great trick I saw Mai and Liz do. Between each presentation, the host reminds the next presenter it's their turn, and warns the on-deck presenter so that they are not caught surprised. Maybe like:

> "Now we'll see <your name>'s something! <other name>, you're on-deck!"

Then maybe the host invites the presenter to share however (screenshare, hold something up to camera, sing a song). Then, the host asks the question on everyone's mind (or maybe asks everyone to unmute and say it together? Is this a game show now?):

> What's that?!

Then the presenter answers that question. They can say anytime "I'll take questions now," and facilitators will help pick out questions from the audience (so it's not on the presenter to be fair). 

Repeat for however many people are prepared (or jump in at the end unprepared?! why not?) and for how much time allows.

Other thoughts: Should there be a time limit? I know I get ramble-y, and I wouldn't want to short anyone else their time. Maybe it depends on how many people sign up. So we can't ever guarantee there will be time for everyone. So maybe we prioritize first-timers/least-recent-ers? sf 80 people show up prepared, 5 minutes each, we can't do 7ish hours of this, right? That's crazy? 

Note from Mai: Let each person describe what kind of feedback/questions they want. That will maximize the comfort of people who may need to be a bit more comfortable to cross the fence from not presenting to presenting.

Read [Julia Evans's blog post about git commits](https://jvns.ca/blog/2024/01/05/do-we-think-of-git-commits-as-diffs--snapshots--or-histories/) which got me hooked on [git internals for the afternoon](https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/09/14/in-a-git-repository--where-do-your-files-live-/).

In the evening, I watched some YouTube.

Watched ["Cursorless: A spoken language for editing code" by Pokey Rule (Strange Loop 2023)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUJnmBqHTY) about a structural editor driven by voice commands. Very cool. Good description of `tree-sitter`, a tool I'd heard of but never understood. Also learned about the term "Tacit programming languages" to refer to point-free languages. Not sure the difference between "tacit" and "point-free", or if they're synonymous.

Still reading all the Zulip, but I feel less overwhelmed and more enthused about all the bright and smart conversations happening and the privilege to have the time and space to explore! 

Watched ["Concatenative programming and stack-based languages" by Douglas Creager](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umSuLpjFUf8). Really good, fast description of concatenative languages. Also great description of an argument for a novel language's Turing Completeness by comparison to another known language.

Creager mentioned [Uxn](https://100r.co/site/uxn.html) on the subject of stack-based languages. I'd heard of https://100r.co before and was always impressed with their work. At the bottom of the page I saw:

> Uxn can also run on classic consoles and on old electronics. Currently, there are ports(not all are complete) for GBA, Nintendo DS, **Playdate**, DOS, PS Vita, Raspberri Pi Pico, Teletype, ESP32, Amiga, iOS, STM32, IBM PC, and many more.

Following the thread of Uxn, I watched ["Weathering Software Winter", Handmade Seattle 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJuOwy4aGA) by Devine of Hundred Rabbits (100r.co). Devine mentions the importance of learning SmallTalk and the path from their to Lisp Machines. I had learned about SmallTalk a little in the past, but I had never studied Lisp machines. Likened those systems to the empowerment of View Source on the web (and how it's reducing over time). Referenced [Bell Lab's Cardboard Computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CARDboard_Illustrative_Aid_to_Computation) which fascinated me.
