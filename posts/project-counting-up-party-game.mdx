# Project: Counting-Up Party Game 

I had an idea for a game.

## Inspiration

The mechanic of a group counting up via cards is directly from ["The Mind" designed by Wolfgang Warsch](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/244992/mind). That game restricts all communication to promote tension and uncertainty. The game described here is more ridiculous and unwieldy. 

The idea of switching communication methods was inspired by the classic parlor game ["Fishbowl"](https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Fish-Bowl), later immortalized into the mechanics of ["Monikers" by Alex Hague & Justin Vickers](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/156546/monikers).

By the time I'd started this page, I'd already played the game at 3 different parties and gotten really positive feedback.

I recorded all of the communication method details I had on my most recent version of the cards into a JavaScript data structure [in a new page file on my site here](https://github.com/reedspool/reeds-website/blob/main/pages/counting-up-party-game.tsx#L1)

<Future>I began to make a generated printable page on my website so I could upgrade from hand-drawn-and-cut cards to stylistic, printed cards. My friend said he would help me laminate, and I wanted a visual I could be proud of before I did that. Laminating it somehow felt significant in that way.</Future>
