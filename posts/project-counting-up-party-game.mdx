# Project: Counting-Up Party Game 

I had an idea for a game.

## Inspiration

The mechanic of a group counting up via cards is directly from ["The Mind" designed by Wolfgang Warsch](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/244992/mind). That game restricts all communication to promote tension and uncertainty. The game described here is more ridiculous and unwieldy. 

The idea of switching communication methods was inspired by the classic parlor game ["Fishbowl"](https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Fish-Bowl), later immortalized into the mechanics of ["Monikers" by Alex Hague & Justin Vickers](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/156546/monikers). 

## Name ideas

I need a name for this game. Just going to brainstorm ideas here:

1. Count Away
2. The Count
3. The Counting
4. Count Together
5. Count Up

By the time I'd started this page, I'd already played the game at 3 different parties and gotten really positive feedback.

I recorded all of the communication method details I had on my most recent version of the cards into a JavaScript data structure [in a new page file on my site here](https://github.com/reedspool/reeds-website/blob/main/pages/counting-up-party-game.tsx#L1)

<Future>I began to make a generated printable page on my website so I could upgrade from hand-drawn-and-cut cards to stylistic, printed cards. My friend said he would help me laminate, and I wanted a visual I could be proud of before I did that. Laminating it somehow felt significant in that way.</Future>

I had a random side thought about constraints-based programming in web development. E.g. the constraint "this content should fit comfortably inside its container". How would you test that in JavaScript (outside a browser)? I don't know of a way. But within a browser, I know a test for that: 

1. Make the content `overflow: auto`
2. If a scrollbar appears, then it doesn't fit.
3. If no scrollbar appears, then it fits.

But the only way to see if that constraint would hold up is to run the program in the browser environment, because there's no simulation for the complex rules of the browser. 

And here's where Playwright comes in. Playwright is a headless controller for a browser. So if I could ask Playwright to run my site, and verify my constraints live, then I'd have a live constraint solver.

For this project, I could imagine that being very useful for making some contraint-based assertions on the shapes of cards.

<Future>I thought  of another communication method: "everyone yells their number all at once on the count of three. You cannot say your number again. You can say other people's numbers"</Future>
