# Add RSS to my site.

First I found how to get the RSS feed for one of my favorite YouTube channels which I already happened to follow via an Android RSS aggregator app Feeder:

```sh
curl https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UClZbO3wehSIsPUKLx_X5caw
```

I figured if anyone would have a quality RSS example, it would be YouTube or podcasts.
