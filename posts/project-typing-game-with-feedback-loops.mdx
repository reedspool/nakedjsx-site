Today's prompt for the RC Creative Coding group was:

> Go to an extreme, move back to a more comfortable place

I chewed on it while I ate my lunch. I was reading an article about feedback loops the night before and I thought to play with that idea. I'm not sure how I jumped from there to typing games. But the vision in my head was of a typing game with a goal, and that goal being in a feedback loop with your current typing speed. The faster you typed, the faster the target speed would get. So in order to continue to hit your goal, you'd probably want a consistent pace, to keep the goal consistent.

Since I took time for lunch, I only gave myself some 40 minutes to work on this which included writing out this idea.

I had never made a typing game before. I assumed I would take a some large list of words, and randomize them, and ask the user to type them in order, tracking their progress. I decided to start there and add my concept of speed tracking and goals only after. I didn't want to take too much time planning.

I didn't want to think about where my random words were coming from, so I just [searched online for a generator](https://www.randomlists.com/random-words).

For some reason, Hyperscript didn't love when I put my script blog inside another element. Apparently it only respected top level script tags? This didn't work, but the "FancyScriptTag" outside of the details element did work correctly?
