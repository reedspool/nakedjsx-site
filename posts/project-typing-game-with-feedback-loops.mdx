Today's prompt for the RC Creative Coding group was:

> Go to an extreme, move back to a more comfortable place

I chewed on it while I ate my lunch. I was reading an article about feedback loops the night before and I thought to play with that idea. I'm not sure how I jumped from there to typing games. But the vision in my head was of a typing game with a goal, and that goal being in a feedback loop with your current typing speed. The faster you typed, the faster the target speed would get. So in order to continue to hit your goal, you'd probably want a consistent pace, to keep the goal consistent.

Since I took time for lunch, I only gave myself some 40 minutes to work on this which included writing out this idea.

I had never made a typing game before. I assumed I would take a some large list of words, and randomize them, and ask the user to type them in order, tracking their progress. I decided to start there and add my concept of speed tracking and goals only after. I didn't want to take too much time planning.

I didn't want to think about where my random words were coming from, so I just [searched online for a generator](https://www.randomlists.com/random-words).

For some reason, Hyperscript didn't love when I put my script blog inside another element. Apparently it only respected top level script tags? This didn't work, but the "FancyScriptTag" outside of the details element did work correctly?

```
<details>
<summary>Code</summary>
<FancyScriptTag type="text/hyperscript">
{`log 'Online'`}
</FancyScriptTag>
</details>
```

It was relatively quick to see the progress of typing by manipulation of the text nodes. This first version was confusing since there was some whitespace issues. I played with the CSS whitespace mode to see if I could match reality to how I felt the whitespace should work. I fixed the whitespace problem not with CSS but by not putting newlines between the span elements.

I implemented outlines and an underline on the next letter and a consistent color scheme that I liked quite a bit. Then I did some renaming.

Based on some positive feedback from the RC game dev interest group, I made a few adjustments to the page and to the instructions. First I made the code hidden by default, with a button to unhide it. 

<Future>I wanted to put the code after the game in the HTML, but I didn't know how to do that with Hyperscript. It seemed like Hyperscript required the behavior to be defined prior to the `install`, and that could only happen by putting it higher in the document order. I thought about alternatively using the CSS `order` property, but that seemed like a lot of hubub.</Future>

I had second thoughts about the button, however. My main call to action was to play the game, not to see the source code! Instead I entirely hid the code.

Next I wanted to work on the instructions. Why have the instructions outside the box of the game? This isn't 1985 with game manuals sold in jewel cases alongside cartridges. So I put the instructions inside the box.

I ran into a very annoying bug in my code to do with my extensive use of [`innerText`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/innerText), where new lines were swapped for `<br />` when I set the current `innerText` back to itself with minor modifications. That was mixed with another confusing bug where the visibility and display CSS values were affecting my game code. Because I was using DOM manipulations, somehow using `display:none;` caused `innerText` to not see and manipulate items. I wasn't sure how to deal with that. Maybe I should switch to the less confusing, simpler `innerHTML`?
