# Project: Track My Projects

I want to make incremental progress on my projects with low friction. This drive encourages many <Link slug="improve-this-website">improvements I make to this website</Link>. 

## Criteria

This is an endless effort. I consider it successful in those periods of time where my projects make progress. When no project moves forward for some time, I will try to reflect on this grander project.

## Project Pages

Many of my projects become posts on this site. To distinguish my project posts from other content, I prefix the files with `project-`. This lowers the friction to finding and opening those files on my computer so I can continue to work on them.

I have other prefixes for other kinds of posts. I don't have any better place to explain them so I'll do so here:

| Prefix   | Description                              |
|----------|------------------------------------------|
| project- | Goals which require incremental progress |
| topic-   | Repositories of related links            |

Lately, all of my projects include a project log. This one does. I describe how project logs work and how they help me <Link slug="about-project-logs">here</Link>.

I began this page to describe how I was already labeling my projects.
