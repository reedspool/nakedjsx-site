# Find and Replace Everything

Become proficient with find-and-replace such that you are unafraid of repeat mistakes. To fix one mistake is as easy as fixing a thousand.

When you use [long names](./pattern-use-long-names.md), they are easy to replace because they're easier to target with the "find" step.

One or two find-and-replace actions across multiple files makes for a [very boring git commit](./pattern-boring-git-commits.md) because any other change may confuse the diff.
