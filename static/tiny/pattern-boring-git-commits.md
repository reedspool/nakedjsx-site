# Boring Commits

You will thank yourself for every boring commit. Much is made of clean git history, but consider this current git moment: everytime you commit, you clean up your current `git diff`.

## Dialectic

Use when you have a single change which makes sense on its own. That single change may involve many changes to many lines across many files, but it qualifies as long as it's can be simply, cohesively explained.

Use when you have to show your changes to other people. If one must look at a big set of changes, life is better when some commits are comprehensible at a glance.

Don't use when you can't isolate your changes; don't prioritize git cleanliness over forward momentum, unless your changes confuse even yourself.
