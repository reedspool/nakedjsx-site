Maybe all those
interests were inevitably related, or maybe this game is my attempt to fit all
my favorite tchotchkes in some wrong-sized luggage.</p> <p>An image which has bounced around in my head for a long time is a mad
scientist’s wall filled with an uneven grid of gadgets, panels, latches, knobs,
switches, etc. An unending plane complications. I wonder if I’ve ever seen it or
if I’ve pieced together the image in my mind’s eye from tropes. See Dexter’s Lab,
Dr. Frankenstein, Dr. Strangelove.</p> <p>I wrote a short story about a pilot who gets drunk, hops in his training mech,
destroys his commanding officer’s building, and watches the war playout from a
prison cell. I wrote another story of a pilot who wakes up in a bed of
jelly-like tub of micro-organisms. I wanted to explore “different mechs
for different folks,” as opposed to a world where the big robots are
one-type-of-thing. See <a href="https://matrix.fandom.com/wiki/Armored_Personnel_Unit" rel="nofollow">The Matrix
